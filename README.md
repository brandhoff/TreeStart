Now create a separate file for a tree class (e.g. tree.cpp). In the tree file create a class called tree. A tree is characterised by it’s base point in 3D space (x0, y0, z0) as well as it’s height and the amount of branches. In your main function create two trees, one located at the origin of the 3D-space (0,0,0) and one at the top of a mountain (12, 199, 56). Both trees are still small with heights of 3 and 2.5. Furthermore, they do not have any branches. <h4>Exercise 2 – Growing branches</h4> Add a function to your tree that allows to grow an additional branch. Create an additional function that returns the amount of existing branches on the tree. Use the functions to grow branches on both of your trees. <h4>Exercise 3 – Branch – More than just a number</h4> Create a separate file (e.g. branch.cpp) in which you create a branch class. A branch is characterised by the position on the trees stem (a height is sufficient), a length, and a 3D direction in which it grows. In your tree class instead of a number of branches add a list of all existing branches on your tree. Modify your growing branch function to accept a branch, which will be grown on your tree. And the function that previously returned the number of branches has to be modified to return the size of the list of branches. Add an additional function to get the list of branches. Now change your main function to grow branches on your two trees. <h4>Exercise 4 – Don’t leave the leaf</h4> Your branch now should be able to grow leaves. For this create a leaf class and think about parameters your leaf might need to be characterised. Then add a function to your branch class to grow the leaves and find a way for the branch to save it’s leaves. In your main class grow leaves on the branches of your two trees. <h4>Exercise 5 – Flow of time</h4> Let’s add some logic to the growth of branches and leaves. A branch should not be able to grow if the tree is too small and only above a certain threshold (min_growth_height). Also, a branch can only grow if the height of the tree is larger or equal to the height of the branch growing. Furthermore, a tree growing does not only include branches and leaves, but also gaining height, add a function to increase the height of the tree and also a function to get the height of the tree. In a similar fashion, leaves should only be able to grow if the branch is longer than a certain value and should not be able to grow at a position that’s longer than the branch. In the main class create an additional function timeStep(). The function should let all the trees grow by a random value (which is bounded by 0 and some MAX_HEIGHT per time_step) Furthermore, create a variable that holds the mean density of branches per height of a tree. Based on the amount of branches on an existing tree, the height of the tree and the density of branches per height, decide in the timeStep() function if a branch should be grown on the corresponding tree and if so do it at a fitting position. Finally, decide if a leaf should be grown on existing branches of the trees. (cap the amount of leaves per branch for some MAX_LEAVES value). Now create a for loop in your main function that forwards the time in each iteration by the function timeStep(). Print all your trees height, branches and leaves for every time step Note: You might have to create a list of all your created trees and access this list in the timeStep() function. # License [(Back to top)](#table-of-contents) [MIT license](./LICENSE)
